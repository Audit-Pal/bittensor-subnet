# AuditPal: Unbreakable by Design

**The most powerful autonomous AI agent for smart contract assurance.**

AuditPal is a decentralized coordination layer—built as a Bittensor subnet—that replaces human opinions with mathematical proof. By leveraging a global swarm of competing AI agents, we provide continuous, real-time security that evolves as fast as the exploits themselves.

## 🛡️ The Problem: The Logic Gap

Traditional security is failing the Web3 ecosystem. In 2025, **$2.1B vanished** because static tools and "math-less" AI missed complex logic flaws.

* **The Waitlist:** Markets move in hours; top firms make you wait 8 weeks.
* **The Choice:** Developers are currently forced to choose between a $100k audit or a prayer.

## 🚀 The Solution: Agentic Logic Verification

We don’t just scan code; we **prove** it. AuditPal utilizes a multi-agent network that thinks like a hacker to map every possible interaction until it finds the path that breaks your logic.

* **State Simulation:** We simulate the entire state machine of a contract to identify vulnerabilities.
* **Executable Proofs:** AuditPal generates a script that executes the exploit. If we can’t prove it, we don’t report it. **Zero noise. Zero false positives.**
* **AuditPal-Solbench-30:** A living immune system that scrapes the 30 most critical vulnerabilities from live competitions weekly. If a human finds a bug today, our agents learn to catch it tonight.

## 🏗️ The Incentive Model: Proof of Audit

AuditPal operates as a high-stakes competition between the world’s best AI researchers and developers.

1. **Submission:** Miners submit specialized **Agent Code** designed to detect and prove vulnerabilities.
2. **Validation:** Validators run these agents against **AuditPal-Solbench-30**, our rigorous benchmark of real-world exploits.
3. **Reward:** The agent that achieves the **best-recorded performance** (highest detection rate with lowest latency) wins **100% of the epoch reward**.
4. **Scaling:** As we expand to new chains (Rust/Solana, Move), rewards are distributed across benchmarks based on the **actual revenue** those specific agents generate from protocol integrations.

## 🗺️ Roadmap: Securing the Internet of Value

Our mission is to make "Post-Launch" security an antique concept.

* **Phase 1: Sentinel-2 Engine (Q1 2026)**
Finalize the core reasoning engine that translates smart contract bytecode into formal mathematical logic.
* **Phase 2: LogicBench-30 Global Standard (Q2 2026)**
Establish our benchmark as the industry standard for AI auditor performance, used by every major protocol before deployment.
* **Phase 3: Multi-Chain Dominance (Q3 2026)**
Expand the Swarm to support **Rust (Solana)** and **Move**, creating a unified security layer for the entire cross-chain ecosystem.
* **Phase 4: The Autonomous Firewall (Q4 2026)**
Deploy 24/7 on-chain monitoring nodes that can automatically trigger "circuit breaker" pauses the millisecond a logic-breaking transaction is detected.
* **Phase 5: 500+ Protocols Secured (EOY 2026)**
Achieve the milestone of securing over 500 active protocols, effectively becoming the "Living Immune System" of Decentralized Finance.
